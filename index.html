  <h2 style="color:#881028;font-family:tahoma"> About me </h2>
  <p>I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Glasgow, supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~mwemyss/"> Michael Wemyss </a>. 

  My interests centre around homological algebra, representation theory as well as noncommutative algebraic geometry. I am currently thinking about derived equivalences and autoequivalences between singular threefold flops. I am also working on a joint project about Paquette-Yıldırım categories and their relation to singularity categories.

  I am the Glasgow organiser for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gears-seminar/home"> GEARS Seminar </a> and I previously co-organised the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pgseminar/home"> Glasgow PG Seminar </a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lewisdean/"> Lewis Dean </a>.
